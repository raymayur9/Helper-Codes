# CS Fundamentals Questions for Software Development Engineering Role

**Query:** Imagine you are an interviewer and you're interviewing candidates in an engineering college in India for Software Development Engineering role. Please ask some CS Fundamentals questions & also provide the answers.

## What are the various categories of software?

* System software: This type of software is responsible for managing the computer hardware and providing an environment for running other software. Examples of system software include operating systems, compilers, and device drivers.
* Application software: This type of software is designed to help users perform specific tasks. Examples of application software include word processors, web browsers, and games.

## What are the characteristics of software?

* Abstraction: Software hides the details of how it works from the user. This allows users to focus on the task at hand, without having to worry about the underlying implementation.
* Modularity: Software is typically divided into smaller, self-contained modules. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and modify the software.
* Reusability: Software can be reused in other applications. This can save time and effort in development.
* Portability: Software can be moved from one computer to another. This makes it easier to deploy software to different environments.

## What is a framework?

A framework is a software platform that provides a structure for developing applications. Frameworks typically include pre-written code, libraries, and tools that can be used to speed up the development process.

## What is the main difference between a computer program and computer software?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Computer software is a collection of computer programs, data, and documentation that provides a solution to a specific problem.

## Describe the Software Development Process in Brief.

The Software Development Process (SDP) is a set of steps that are followed to develop software. The SDP typically includes the following steps:

* Requirements gathering: This step involves identifying the needs of the users and stakeholders.
* Design: This step involves creating a detailed plan for how the software will be implemented.
* Implementation: This step involves writing the code for the software.
* Testing: This step involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the requirements.
* Deployment: This step involves making the software available to users.
* Maintenance: This step involves fixing bugs and adding new features to the software.
